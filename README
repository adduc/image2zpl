What it does
============

image2zpl converts images supported by the GD library (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WBMP, 
and GD2) into ZPL graphics for thermal label printers.

Supported image formats
=======================

Works with images supported by the GD library (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WBMP, and GD2).

WBMP is recommended. image2zpl uses WBMP internally as an intermediate format
because it is rather similar to ZPL's encoding (monochrome, not compressed, 
left-to-right and top-to-bottom rendering, very simple header).
